# LiFe-Youth-Website

My client, Ani Santoso, is the lead for the children’s ministry department at the Living Stones Fellowship Church, where she supervises five classes of different age groups.  During the interview, she expressed that although the classes themselves are taught at an exceptional quality, she feels unable to effectively communicate the results to the parents.  This has led to an inability to expand the learning experience outside of the classroom.
